In general,
they are apprentice teachers and are here to learn how to run a
course. At the same time, though, they are your peers who have taken
the course, and can see your problems from your perspective.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Communications)"></a>Communications</h4><p>If you need help, you may talk to the instructor or the TAs during their office hours.</p><p><span style="color: red">Posting or sharing parts of a solution to any parts of a homework assignment is considered
cheating. Even after it is due. <span style="font-weight: bold">You don&rsquo;t want to do this.</span></span> Limit your answers to other students to providing
clarity when needed and hints when appropriate. This is good practice should you ever want to be on staff :)</p><h4><a name="(part._.General_.Policies)"></a>General Policies</h4><ul><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Late assignment policy:</span> An assignment that is one second late is automatically
  counted as a full day late. Each student gets four free, no-questions-asked late days for
  the term. The purpose of late days is make the extension process fair and transparent by getting
  the instructors out of the extension-granting business entirely. Instead, when you need an
  extension, you can take one&#8212;provided you have a late day remaining.</p><p>To use a late day, just email your instructor the homework. Your instructor will upload it to the server
  and keep track of the number of used late days, and will prevent you from submitting more than one day
  late to any assignment, or late at all if you&#8217;ve used all your late days. Conserve your late days carefully.</p><p>No more than one late day may be used on any one homework. Late days cannot be divided
  fractionally, but must be used whole. Late days cannot be transferred to or shared with
  a partner, so in order to take an extension both you and your partner must have sufficient
  late days remaining. Choose your partners carefully. </p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Laptop policy:</span> No laptops in class. I can hand-write code, so can you.</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Academic honesty:</span> We will strictly enforce the school, college, and department&rsquo;s
academic integrity policies.  You may discuss problems with other students, but you may
 not share or show code to anyone other than your assigned partner or the
 course staff.  Violations of academic integrity will be reported and
 will have a negative impact on your grade. Likewise <span style="font-weight: bold">do not</span> try and use Java code that you have found on the internet or procured from internet-like sources. Any Java code you find off the internet will be wrong, incorrect style, obviously taken from the internet, and worth zero points.</p></li></ul><h4><a name="(part._general-lectures)"></a>Lectures</h4><blockquote><p>Section 1: Monday and Wednesday at 9:30&ndash;10:45 am<br/><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>SC 109<span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hemann</p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Lectures policy:</span></p><p>You are required to read the lecture material for the given lecture before
coming to class. During the lectures we will discuss the material
covered in the required reading, answer questions, provide
additional examples and applications.</p><p>It is OK if you do not understand everything when you first read it,
but reading about the new concept ahead of the time will give you
a chance to anticipate the questions you may have and allow you
to follow better the details of explanation during the lectures.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Recitations</span></p><p>The goal of the recitations is to see in practice problems that illustrate
the concepts covered in the lectures, and to prepare you for the next
programming assignment.</p><p>There is a lot of technical detail related to running Java programs that will
be covered in the early recitations.  Later ones may focus more on design questions
and on good Java programming practice.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">In-class Quizzes and Code review</span></p><p>We will be running quizzes during several of the classes,
possibly without prior warning. The goal of the quizzes is to see that
you are familiar with the most basic concepts covered during
the recent lectures and assignments.</p><p>Quizzes will be graded, and are counted as part of your exam scores
(see <a href="#%28part._.Exams%29" data-pltdoc="x">Exams</a> below).  The intent is to assess your progress in
the course in smaller chunks rather than just through lengthy midterm exams.</p><p>If you do not pass the quiz, you need to meet with the instructor
within the next week, to identify the problems you
may have and to help you get back on track. Only one makeup of a quiz will be allowed.</p><p>We may also conducting walking code reviews, of material from recent
homework assignments. As presenters, be prepared to explain your
design choices to your classmates. As reviewers, pay attention both to
how the presenters organize their explanations and how they organize
their code, and feel free to ask clarifying questions about either.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Computing_.Environment)"></a>Computing Environment</h4><p>You will complete your assignments (other than the first
one) using the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/">IntelliJ IDE</a>. Though, if you feel more
comfortable, you may choose to use another IDE (e.g. NetBeans) or work
directly from the command line, but you and your partner must both be
comfortable with the chosen programming environment, and the staff may
not be able to assist you with issues encountered in other
environments.</p><p>You will use <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">the handin server</a> to submit
your homework.  You may submit as many times as you wish, though submitting too
frequently will be detected and rate-limited, to ensure fairness for other
students.  Be aware that close to the deadline when everyone submits all at
once, the server will become less responsive.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Assignments._(general))"></a>Assignments</h4><p>There will be one problem set each week. As with CSAS1114/1115, the
problem sets will include ungraded exercises and practice problems,
that you are strongly encouraged to look at and confirm that you can
solve. You are welcome to bring solutions to these problems to the
course staff during the semester for informal feedback on how you&rsquo;re
doing.</p><p>The graded problems are to be solved collaboratively with your partner.  The
problems will consist of structured programming assignments that may be based
on the work done in previous weeks, and may also include more creative projects
where you can practice your design skills.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Due Dates: <span class="emph">Thursdays at 10:00pm,</span></span> unless otherwise
specified. See the late policy above.</p><p><span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span></span> You will submit each problem <span class="emph">separately</span> on
the handin server. This is for your benefit: the server will attempt
to compile and run your program against automated test cases. Having
separate submissions for each problem means that a syntax error in one
problem won&rsquo;t immediately prevent your other problems from compiler
also. Be careful to submit the correct answers to the correct
problems.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Pair_.Programming)"></a>Pair Programming</h4><p>You must work on problem sets in pairs. We will assign you a partner. You will
switch partners a few times during the semester.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Important</span>
Pair programming means that you and your partner work on the problem
sets jointly. You read them together and you work on the solutions
together. One of the lab&rsquo;s purposes is to teach you how to work in
pairs effectively; indeed, pairs are provably more effective than
individuals in programming. The rough idea is this: One of you plays
<span class="emph">pilot</span>, the other <span class="emph">co-pilot</span>. The pilot works on the
keyboard and explains aloud what is going on; it is the co-pilot&rsquo;s
responsibility to question everything. After a problem is solved to
the satisfaction of both, you <span class="emph">must</span> switch roles.</p><p>Every partner must be able to solve every homework problem in the
end. In other words, you must be able to solve every homework problem
on your own.</p><p>If you are having difficulties working with your partner, please inform your
instructor quickly: we cannot help if we don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s a
problem.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Academic_.Integrity)"></a>Academic Integrity</h4><p>All programs must be completed strictly by you and your partner. You may discuss the problem sets with others. However, <span style="font-weight: bold"><span class="emph">you may not share code in any way</span>. Your code should not look as though it came from someone or somewhere else. Submitting code that
is not your own will be considered a violation of the University&rsquo;s Academic
Integrity Policy .</span>  Violations of academic integrity will be
reported, and will have strong consequences
on your grade, from an automatic zero on the assignment to failing the course.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">NOTE:</span></span> Be aware that while <span class="emph">submitting</span> someone else&rsquo;s code is
clearly a violation, so is <span class="emph">sharing your code with others</span>, even if you
truly just mean to help.  Outside an academic environment, sharing code with
unauthorized parties can be a criminal offense and have severe and
unanticipated consequences.</p><p>If you are ever unsure of whether sharing is unacceptable or not, ask one of the course staff.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Exams)"></a>Exams</h4><p>You may bring one sheet of notes to exams (may be typed or hand-written, one-sided or double-sided).</p><h4><a name="(part._.Grades)"></a>Grades</h4><p><div class="SIntrapara">Your final grade is composed of:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">40% homework</span>.  Most homeworks will be equally weighted; homework 5
will be worth more, and homeworks 9 and 10 will be worth double: these are
larger projects and will take more time.</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">55% quizzes and exams</span>, with exact proportions to be determined.</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">5% participation</span>, meaning active participation in class and lab</p></li></ul></div></p><p>There will likely be some small amount of extra credit available on the last
two assignments.  Details to be determined.</p><p>As before, you can use the handin server to see the current weights of each
assignment, and your approximate grade in the course so far.  <span style="font-weight: bold">The exact
weights of assignments, quizzes and exams will change during the semester,
depending on exactly how many of each we have.  We will let you know when we
update these weights, and will try to keep it as infrequent as possible.</span></p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="tocsettoggle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="javascript:void(0);" title="show/hide table of contents" onclick="TocsetToggle();">contents</a></span></span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="backward to &quot;CSAS-2123
